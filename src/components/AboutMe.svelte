      Hi, nice to meet you!<br /><br />My name is Vanessa. I am a Web
      Developer. My nickname is Vannsl since I lost various passwords for Vanny in 1998.<br /><br />
      I'm a <OutgoingLink href="https://www.vuevixens.org/">Frontend Foxes</OutgoingLink> Chapter Leader,
      helping others with their first coding and speaking experiences while
      learning from them, too. In 2020 I started the Frontend Testing Podcast
      <OutgoingLink href="https://www.expect-exception.fail">expect(Exception)</OutgoingLink>.
      Also in 2020, I was a member of the JS Kongress Program Committee. I work as a Software Developer at
      <OutgoingLink href="https://www.zage.life/?utm_source=vannsl&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=website&amp;utm_content=frontend">ZAGE</OutgoingLink>.
      From 2010-2015 I studied Media Informatics with a focus on Human-Computer-Interaction. Now I am striving to
      provide customers with the best experience possible while creating modern
      and accessible web applications. When I write code, I don't do it for myself but for the next developer.
      In my spare time, I like to do some sports and drink (for scientific purposes) wine on my Wine Podcast
